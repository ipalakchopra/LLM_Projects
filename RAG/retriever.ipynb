Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

First, the input is split into a set of vectors, called \"keys,\" \"values,\" and \"queries.\" The keys and values represent the input data, and the queries represent the context in which the input data is being processed.\\n2. Next, the queries, keys, and values are linearly transformed using learned weight matrices WQ, WK, and WV. This transformation allows the model to learn the relative importance of each key with respect to the query.\\n3. The queries and keys are then dot-producted to compute a set of attention weights, which represent the degree to which each key should be \"attended\" to in order to compute the output.\\n4. The attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the values, resulting in the final output.\\n\\nIn the context of the Transformer architecture, the attention function is used to compute the output of the decoder, which is responsible for generating the target language sequence.
